# REST API Penetration Testing with Astra

REST API penetration testing can be complex due to continuous changes in existing APIs and the addition of new APIs. Astra simplifies this process, making it a valuable tool for both security engineers and developers. By integrating Astra into the development cycle, vulnerabilities can be detected and patched early, ensuring secure APIs from the ground up.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration into CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Astra can automatically detect and test login and logout functionality (Authentication APIs). This makes it easy to incorporate into any CI/CD pipeline, streamlining security checks throughout the development process.

- **Standalone Testing Mode**  
  Astra accepts API collections as input, enabling comprehensive testing of APIs even in standalone mode.

## Benefits

1. Early detection and patching of vulnerabilities during development.
2. Automated authentication API testing.
3. Flexibility to test APIs in standalone mode or within CI/CD pipelines.

By leveraging Astra, teams can proactively secure their APIs, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring robust, secure systems.
